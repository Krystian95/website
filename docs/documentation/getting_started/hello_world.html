<h2>Hello World</h2><p>A Jolie program defines a service. A service achieves complex tasks by composing other services. An example of a very simple service is the following:</p>
<div class="code" src="hello_world_1.ol"></div><p>The program above reads as:</p>
<ul>
  <li>include the source file console.iol;</li>
  <li>send the message <code>&quot;Hello, world!&quot;</code> to the <code>println</code> operation of the <code>Console</code> service.</li>
</ul><p>We can already see some characteristics of a Jolie program:</p>
<ul>
  <li>we can include other source files by means of the <code>include</code> primitive;</li>
  <li>the entry point of a Jolie program is the <code>main</code> code block;</li>
  <li>we can send a message to a service with a native primitive (Line 4).</li>
</ul><p>The last point differs from classical programming languages and is peculiar to Jolie: the <code>println@Console( &quot;Hello, world!&quot; )()</code> line is a <a href="basics/communication_ports.html">solicit-response</a> statement, which is a communication primitive.</p>
<hr/><h2>Running a Jolie service</h2><p>Jolie programs are saved in files named with the <code>.ol</code> extension. For example, we can save the code of the service above in a file called <code>myFirstJolieService.ol</code>. Then, we can run it by executing the following command:</p><p><kbd>jolie myFirstJolieService.ol</kbd></p><p>which will print the string <code>Hello, world!</code>.</p>
