<h2>Constants</h2><p>It is possible to define constants by means of the construct <code>constants</code>. The declarations of the constants are divided by commas. The syntax is:</p>
<div class="syntax" src="syntax_constants_1.ol"></div><p>As an example let us consider the following code:</p>
<div class="code" src="constants_1.ol"></div><p>Constants might also be assigned on the command line. Just call a program using <code>jolie -C Server_location=\&quot;socket://localhost:4003\&quot; program.ol</code> to override <code>Server_location</code>. We can even remove its declaration from the <code>constants</code> list in case of a mandatory command line assignment.</p>
