<h2>Jolie2wsdl</h2><p>Jolie2wsdl is the counterpart of <a href="web_services/wsdl2jolie.html">wsdl2jolie</a> tool. It allows the creation of a WSDL document starting from a Jolie Interface.</p><h2>The syntax</h2>
<hr/><p>The syntax of jolie2wsdl follows:</p>
<div class="syntax" src="syntax_jolie2wsdl.ol"></div><p>where:</p>
<ul>
  <li><code>-i include_file_path</code> must be set if the jolie service includes <code>.iol</code> files belonging to Jolie standard library (e.g., <code>console.iol</code>). For example this path, in a Linux environment, is <code>/opt/jolie/include</code>;</li>
  <li><code>filename.ol</code> is the jolie service file whose input port must be transformed into a soap one;</li>
  <li><code>soap_input_port_name</code> is the name of the port to be exposed as a web service. It has to be defined in soap protocol;</li>
  <li><code>output_file</code> is the file where the generated WSDL document is stored (<code>MyWsdl.wsdl</code> is the default value).</li>
</ul>
<hr/><h2>Jolie interface guidelines</h2><p>When programming a Jolie interface to be transformed into a WSDL document, its recommended to follow these guidelines:</p><p>Native types in operation declaration are not permitted. For example, the following declaration is forbidden:</p>
<div class="code" src="jolie2wsdl_1.ol"></div><p>All complex types must have a void value in the root. Hence, the following declaration are not permitted:</p>
<div class="code" src="jolie2wsdl_2.ol"></div><p>Thus, the right types and interface declaration for our example may be:</p>
<div class="code" src="jolie2wsdl_3.ol"></div>
