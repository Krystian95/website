<h2>Web services</h2><p>Interacting with Web Services usually implies reading some WSDL (Web Service Description Language) document. Unfortunately, WSDL documents are written in XML and can be pretty complicated, leaving the user with no other choice than to use some graphical development tool in order to understand them.</p><p>Jolie supports the SOAP protocol, but using it means manually coding the interface and data types of the Web Service to invoke.</p><p><em>wsdl2jolie</em> (whose executable is installed by default in Jolie standard trunk) is a tool that takes a URL to a WSDL document and automatically downloads all the related files (e.g., referred XML schemas), parses them and outputs the corresponding Jolie port/interface/data type definitions.</p>
<hr/><h2>The syntax</h2><p>The syntax of wsdl2jolie follows:</p>
<div class="syntax" src="syntax_wsdl2jolie.ol"></div><p><code>wdsl_uri</code> can be a URL or a file path (in case of local usage).</p><p>The output the tool returns is a set of service declarations (in Jolie) needed for invoking the web service.</p>
<hr/><h2>Wsdl2jolie example</h2><p>Let us consider an example of a WSDL document for a service that calculates prime numbers, the WSDL URL is <code>http://www50.brinkster.com/vbfacileinpt/np.asmx?wsdl</code>. </p><p>Reading the raw XML is not so easy, or at least requires some time.</p><p>If we execute the command <code>wsdl2jolie http://www50.brinkster.com/vbfacileinpt/np.asmx?wsdl</code> our output will be </p>
<div class="code" src="wsdl2jolie_1.ol"></div><p>which is the Jolie equivalent of the WSDL document. Those <code>.wsdl</code> and <code>.wsdl.port</code> parameters are improvement to the SOAP protocol: when the output port is used for the first time, Jolie will read the WSDL document for processing information about the correct configuration for interacting with the service instead of forcing the user to manually insert it.</p><p>Once our interface is created, we can store it into a file, e.g., PrimeNumbers.iol, and use the output ports we discovered from Jolie code. As in the following:</p>
<div class="code" src="wsdl2jolie_2.ol"></div><p>Our little program will output <code>1,3,5,7,11,13,17,19,23</code>. </p><p>The comprehensive code of this example can be downloaded from the link below:</p>
<div class="download"><a href="documentation/web_services/code/wsdl2jolie_code.zip">Web Services Code Example</a></div><p>Remarkably, wsdl2jolie has two benefits: it acts as a useful tool that creates the typed interface of a Web Service from Jolie and creates a more human-readable form of a WSDL document (i.e., its Jolie form).</p>
<hr/><h2>The generated document</h2><p>wdsl2jolie creates a document which contains:</p>
<ul>
  <li>the types contained into (or referred by) the WSDL;</li>
  <li>the Jolie interface with all the operation declarations;</li>
  <li>the Jolie outputPort ports needed for the Web Service invocation.</li>
</ul>
<hr/><h3>Mapping</h3><p>In the following table we show the mapping between WSDL elements and Jolie elements:</p><p>WSDL Jolie ---------------- -------------------- <code>&lt;types&gt;</code> <code>type</code> <code>&lt;messages&gt;</code> <code>type</code> <code>&lt;portType&gt;</code> <code>interface</code> <code>&lt;binding&gt;</code> <code>outputPort:Protocol</code> <code>&lt;service:port&gt;</code> <code>outputPort</code></p>
<hr/><h2>SOAP outputPort</h2><p>The SOAP outputPorts are generated with two parameters:</p>
<ul>
  <li><code>wsdl</code>, which sets the location of the WSDL document;</li>
  <li><code>wsdl.port</code>, which sets the WSDL port related to the current outputPort.</li>
</ul><p>Plus, another parameter can be added in order to display debug messages, which is <code>debug</code>; if set to 1, all the SOAP messages of the current outputPort are displayed on the standard output.</p><p>The <code>wsdl</code> and <code>wsdl.port</code> parameters are needed for formatting the messages to and from the web service in conformance with the WSDL document.</p>
<hr/><h2>Jolie Metaservice</h2><p>Another feature that derives from the improvement of the SOAP protocol is that now Jolie standard library <em>MetaService</em> can act as a transparent bridge between Web Services.</p><p>Once set the <code>addRedirection</code> operation with the right protocol configuration (e.g., the <code>.wsdl</code> and <code>.wsdl.port</code> parameters), MetaService automatically downloads the WSDL document - which is automatically cached -, and make it callable by clients.</p><p>Hence, it becomes really easy to use libraries such as QtJolie which requires only the location of the WSDL document to enable a client to call the Web Service of interest.</p><p>Plus, using wsdl2jolie combined with other tools, such as jolie2plasma, enables to use the aforementioned Jolie intermediate representation for transforming a Web Service interface definition into one compatible with a (KDE) Plasma::Service XML. In the same way, C++ generators can be written for QtJolie, introducing ease and type-safeness to Web Services invocations.</p><p>So far not all the WSDL and SOAP features are supported, which can raise compatibility problems when using them:</p>
<ul>
  <li>SOAP 1.2, currently NOT supported;</li>
  <li>XML Schema Extended types, currently NOT supported;</li>
  <li>HTTP GET and HTTP POST, currently HALF supported as Web Service calls.</li>
</ul>
