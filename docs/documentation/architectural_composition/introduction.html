<h2>Architectural composition</h2><p>In the Basics section we have shown how a behaviour can compose other behaviours abstracting from its deployment. In Architectural Composition section we show how composition can be obtained from the opposite perspective.</p><p><em>Architectural composition</em> is a different kind of composition that a deployment definition can obtain abstracting from the specific behavioural definitions of the involved services.</p><p>Architectural composition can be roughly divided in two main categories.</p><p>The first deals with structuring the execution contexts in which services operate. For instance, a service may execute other sub-services in the same execution engine in order to gain advantages in terms of resource control. Other examples can be <em>wrapping</em> and <em>hiding</em> an entity in an SOA.</p><p>The second category deals with the topology of the connections between services in an SOA.</p><p>Jolie supports mechanisms for both categories, whose main representatives are introduced in this section.</p>
