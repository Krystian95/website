<h2>Dynamic Embedding</h2><p>In the previous subsections we showed how to statically embed services. A statically embedded service is shared among all sessions created by the embedder, enabling any of them to access shared (persistent) data.</p><p>Dynamic embedding makes possible to associate a unique embedded instance (session) to the embedder, thus allowing only that specific instance to invoke the operations of the embedded service.</p><p>Let us consider a specification of a service that allows clients to start a timed-counter. The counter sends back to its invoker the value of an incremental count every second.</p><p>First, we implement the specification as an embeddeder with a <code>concurrent</code> behaviour, statically embedding a counter service. A new instance of the embedder is created each time a new client invokes the <code>startNewCounter</code> operation, but still the embedded service <code>CounterService</code> is instanced only once and it is shared among all embedder's instances.</p>
<div class="code" src="dynamic_embedding_1.ol"></div><p>Such an implementation is wrong because it diverges from the given specification.</p><p><code>CounterService</code> is a singleton, its operations are accessed by any instance of the embedder, thus each instance of the embedder returns a "global" counting, instead of a single-instanced one.</p><p>We can achieve the right implementation by dynamically embedding the service.</p>
<div class="code" src="dynamic_embedding_2.ol"></div><p>In the example above we include the <code>runtime.iol</code> library (part of Jolie's standard library ) used for realizing the dynamic embedding. At Lines 15-17 we dynamically embed the service <code>CounterService</code> which creates a new instance of the embedded service each time a new instance of the embedder is started.</p><p>The comprehensive code examples of both the static (wrong) and dynamic embedding can be downloaded here:</p>
