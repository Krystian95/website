<p>An embedded service in Jolie can communicate with its embedder exploiting the <code>local</code> medium. <code>local</code> communications uses the shared memory between embedded and embedder services in order to handle message delivery in an lightweight and efficient way.</p>
<p>The <code>local</code> medium has no parameters and needs no protocol when used into a protocol definition.</p>
<p>An example using this medium can be found in part &quot;Handling structured messages and embedder's operations invocation&quot; of <a href="architectural_composition/embedding_java.html">Embedding Java Services</a> subsection.</p>
<p>The <code>local</code> medium can be used for service internal self communications, as shown in the example below:</p>
<div class="code" src="local.ol"></div>

<p>The operation <code>hanoi</code> receives an external http request (e.g., a GET <code>http://localhost:8000/hanoi?src=source&amp;aux=auxiliary&amp;dst=destination&amp;n=5</code>) and fires the local operation <code>hanoiSolver</code> which uses the <code>local</code> location for recursively call itself and build the solution.</p>
