<h2 id="rmi">RMI</h2>
<p>RMI (Remote Method Invocation) is a Java API provided as an object-oriented equivalent of remote procedure calls.</p>
<p>RMI location name in Jolie's port definition is <code>rmi</code>. This transport uses its own internal RMI protocol, so theoretically no other protocol needs to be specified.</p>

<h2 id="rmi-locations-protocols">RMI locations and protocols</h2>
<p>When using RMI Jolie registers the port into a Java RMI Register service. RMI locations are in the form <code>rmi://hostname:port/name</code> where the parameter <code>name</code> is mandatory and must be unique.</p>
<p>Due to a Jolie parsing restriction, which forces all non-local input ports to have a protocol associated, users may set <code>Protocol: sodep</code>.</p>
