Jolie provides a single linguistic domain for addressing different issues of distributed programming, in a service-oriented style.
Thanks to Jolie you can build distributed systems starting from the development of simple services, building up to complex architectures through
the creation of service orchestrators and native primitives for system composition.
<ul>
  <li><b>Simple services:</b> you can build simple services starting from scratch. 
You can connect them to databases such as SQLServer, PostgreSQL, MySQL, etc.,
and provide service operations for accessing them.
Deploying a Jolie service is very simple, just type <i>jolie</i> followed
by the service filename in a command shell!
  </li>
  <li><b>Orchestrators:</b> you can build new services by coordinating the existing ones, by developing <i>orchestrators</i>.
Differently from other service-oriented technologies, Jolie makes no difference between services and orchestrators.
Hence, you can approach orchestrator programming by composing the same primitives that you know for service programming.
  </li>
  <li><b>Web Applications:</b> in Jolie, a web application is simply a specific instance of a service.
  The native http protocol offered by Jolie handles AJAX calls and common HTTP requests automatically,
  so you can seamlessly deploy a service with a web GUI.</li>
  <li><b>System composition:</b> you can integrate and compose existing SOAs (even those developed with other technologies)
  by using the powerful service composition mechanisms offered by Jolie, such as Aggregation and Redirection.</li>
</ul>

<p>In this section we provide both basic and advanced information about Jolie programming.
We invite you to take a look at all the sections and try our examples.
This documentation is in continuous development, so please send us any comment that could help us to improve it.
