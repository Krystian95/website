<h1>jEye</h1>
<p class="cite">A web designer for Jolie services.</p>
<p>jEye is web application which allows for the design of Jolie workflow by exploiting a web GUI developed in GWT.
The server side of jEye is a Service Oriented Architecture fully implemented with Jolie. In particular, we exploit service recursion for developing the Jolie parser which converts the workflow definition provided	by the web GUI into a real and executable Jolie service. At the present jEys is a prototype.</p>
