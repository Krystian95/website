<h1>Chor</h1>
<p class="cite">a new programming language based on choreographies that supports code generation of Jolie services.</p>
<p>Chor is a new programming language for communicating systems, based on choreographies. Choreographies are global descriptions of system implementations, where the behaviour of all entities in a system is given in a single program. Choreographies enhance the quality of software, as they represent "formal blueprints" of how communicating systems should behave and offer a concise view of the message flows enacted by a system. In Chor, a choreography can then be projected (or compiled, if you like) onto a set of separate programs that can be run in a distributed system.</p>
