JOLIE is all about communicating with services. You can invoke a service or be the service that gets invoked.
Programs get more complex by composing message sendings and/or receivings; as such, the first fundamental notion 
for programming with JOLIE is to understand how to define services and how to communicate.
Ports are necessary both for receiving and sending messages. In Jolie every communication
is fulfilled by means of ports. Three are two kind of ports:
<br><br>
<ul>
<li>Input ports: they are used for receiving messages from other services</li>
<li>Output ports: they are used for sending messages to other services
</ul>

<a name="language_ports_input_ports"/>
<h2>Input Ports</h2>
&gt; <a href="#language_top">Go on top</a><br><br>
Input ports allow you to specify an endpoint for receiving messages
from other applications or services.
The syntax of input port declaration follows:
<div id="syntax" src="syntax_ports_1"/>
An input port is composed by four fundamental information:
<ul>
    <li>a name, unambiguously identifying it among input ports;</li>
    <li>a <a href="#language_ports_location">location</a>, defining the communication medium to use and its parameters;</li>
    <li>a protocol, specifying the protocol to be used to communicate. Check section <a href="#language_protocols">Protocols</a>
for a list of all the available protocols and their settings;</li>
    <li>a list of interfaces (optional) to deploy with the input port; </li>
</ul>
As an example in the following we propose an inputPort able to receive a message on the
operation defined in the example interface of section <a href="#language_interfaces">Interfaces</a>
where <a href="#language_protocols"><i>sodep</i></a> is the Jolie custom protocol.
<div id="example" src="example_ports_4"/>

<a name="language_ports_output_ports"/>
<h2>Output Ports</h2>
&gt; <a href="#language_top">Go on top</a><br><br>
Dually from the inputPort, the outputPort allows for the definition of an endpoint
able to send messages to a correspondent inputPort. Its definition is very similar
to that of inputPort with the exception of the keyword <i>outputPort</i> instead of <i>inputPort</i>.
<div id="syntax" src="syntax_ports_3"/>
The parameters are:
<ul>
    <li>a name, unambiguously identifying it among output ports;</li>
    <li>a <a href="#language_ports_location">location</a>, defining the communication medium to use and its parameters;</li>
    <li>a protocol, specifying the protocol to be used to communicate. Check section <a href="#language_protocols">Protocols</a>
for a list of all the available protocols and their settings;</li>
    <li>a list of interfaces (optional) to deploy with the input port; </li>
</ul>
Differently from inputPorts where the parameters are used for specifying how receiving messages, 
in the outputPorts they are used for defining how sending messages.
As an example we present the declaration of the outputPort able to communicate
with the inputPort defined in the example above:
<div id="example" src="example_ports_5"/>

<a name="language_ports_no_interface"/>
<h2>Declaring operations without using interfaces</h2>
&gt; <a href="#language_top">Go on top</a><br><br>
When a smart programming is required, it is possible to define the operations
available at a given port (an inputPort or an outputPort) without using
interfaces but specifying them into the port declaration.
The following example whows such a tip:
<div id="example" src="example_ports_6"/>

<a name="language_ports_location"/>
<h2>Location</h2>
&gt; <a href="#language_top">Go on top</a><br><br>
A location defines a communication endpoint that Jolie can use in order to open a connection. 
Locations are used both in input ports and output ports.
A location is a <a target="lnk1" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uniform_Resource_Identifier">URI</a>, 
restricted to the communication mediums supported by the interpreter. 
Thus, the syntax of locations can be expressed as: 
<div id="syntax" src="syntax_ports_2"/>
where <i>medium</i> is the name of the communication medium to use and 
<i>medium-specific-part</i> is specific to each different communication medium. 
The <i>!/resource-path part</i> is optional, and is used for <a href="#language_redirection">redirection</a>.
Examples of valid locations are:
<div id="example" src="example_ports_1"/>
<div id="example" src="example_ports_2"/>
<div id="example" src="example_ports_3"/>

<a name="language_ports_location_mediums"/>
<h3>List of available mediums</h3>
<ul>
  <li>socket: it defines the usage of a common socket</li>
  <li>local: it defines the usage of an in-memory communication medium</li>
  <li>localsocket: ??</li>
</ul>
