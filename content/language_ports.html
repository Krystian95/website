JOLIE is all about communicating with services. You can invoke a service or be the service that gets invoked.
Programs get more complex by composing message sendings and/or receivings; as such, the first fundamental notion 
for programming with JOLIE is to understand how to define services and how to communicate.

Ports are necessary both for receiving and sending messages. In Jolie every communication
is fulfilled by means of ports. Three are two kind of ports:
<br><br>
<ul>
<li>Input ports: they are used for receiving messages from other services</li>
<li>Output ports: they are used for sending messages to other services
</ul>
