<h1>Scenario - University work-flow</h1>
Mechanisms exploited in this example:
<ul>
  <li><a href="#language_linkin_and_linkout">linkIn() and linkOut()</a> primitives</li>
  <li><a href="#language_correlation_sets">correlation sets</a></li>
  <li><a href="#language_fault_handling">fault handling</a></li>
</ul>

In this example, we want to create a hypothetical university service for managing student 
project proposals to be realized in a foreigner University. 
In order to submit a project request to the system a student must follow the following specifications:
<ul>
    <li>He has to retrieve the list of his exams</li>
    <li>He has to present his project abstract and title with the list of the exams to an inner tutor in order to be approved</li>
    <li>He has to contact the foreigner University in order to ask for positions availability</li>
    <li>If the project is approved by the tutor and by the foreigner University the student can start it. </li>
</ul>
Such a scenario involves a set of services:
<ul>
    <li>Authentication: this service allows for student authentication</li>
    <li>Secretary: this service allows for retrieving administrative data such as the list of exams</li>
    <li>Tutor: this service manages student requests to the tutor. The tutor receives the project 
    title and abstract and the list of the exams, then it sends back its approval or its rejection</li>
    <li>University: this service is the foreigner service which manages requests from external students.</li>
    <li>Thesis: it is the main service which manages all the student activities for achieving a correct project submission.</li>
</ul>
Here we discuss only the Thesis service. A sketched implementation of the other services is available in the c.
In the Thesis service we will use four outputPort (Authentication, Secretary, Tutor and University) without any input port.
