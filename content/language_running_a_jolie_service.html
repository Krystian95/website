Jolie is a service oriented programming language that you can use to build powerful distributed
systems. In Jolie everything is a service and complex tasks can be achieved by composing 
services each other. An example of a very simple service is the following:
<div id="example" src="example_hello_world_1"/>
The program above can be interpreted as:
<ul>
    <li>include the source file console.iol. The include primitive is discussed in section <a href="#language_include">include</a>;</li>
    <li>send the message "Hello, world!" to the println operation of the Console service </li>
</ul>


We can already see some characteristics of a JOLIE program:

<ul>
    <li>we can include other source files by means of the include directive;</lI>
    <li>the entry point of a JOLIE program is the main scope;</li>
    <li>we can send a message to a service with a one-line statement.</li>
</ul>

The last point differs from classical programming languages and is peculiar to the JOLIE language: 
the <i>println@Console("Hello, world!")()</i> line is a solicit-response statement which is 
a communication primitive.

Now let us run the jolie service introduced above. It is very easy and simple. First of all, save the
source code above into a file and name it <i>myFirstJolieService.ol</i>. Then launch the following
command line:
<div id="example" src="example_hello_world_2"/>
As a result you will see displayed the string <i>Hello world</i> in your console.

<h2>Running a Jolie service with parameters</h2>
&gt; <a href="#language_top">Go on top</a><br><br>
Now, let us modify your first service in order to receive parameters from the command line.
All the parameters are stored in a vector called <i>args</i> where the first parameter
can be retrieved at index 0, the second parameter at index 1 and so on.
<div id="example" src="example_hello_world_3"/>
Save the file with the name <i>mySecondJolieService</i> and try to run it in the following way:
<div id="example" src="example_hello_world_4"/>
</div>
