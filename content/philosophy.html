<h1>The Jolie philosophy</h1>

Jolie is a programming language which aims at providing a coherent, elegant and effective tool
for addressing distributed system design. In order to do that the development of Jolie
is carried on with a continous tradeoff between formal theory and practical requirements. 
On the one hand indeed, the semantics of Jolie is defined by means of a precise formal model 
called SOCK, whereas on the other hand we pay attention to provide an easy and intuitive language syntax.
We use theoretical foundations as a roadmap for designing and mantaining the big picture 
coherence and we take inspiration from practical issues for improving both the model and the language.
Such an approach lights on a virtuous creative process which leads us to discover and investigate
a powerful model and tool for addressing distributed system design.
<br><br>
One of the most important issue in the design of distributed systems, is the management of the 
interaction complexity among all the involved entities. Such an aspect in Jolie is addressed 
by introducing a strong and precise definition of the entities which are involved in a distributed system
and a set of aggregation mechanisms able to compose them in a precise way. The main challenge we are following 
is the possibility to compose distributed entities however you want by always obtaining as a result 
something which can be expressed as a single entity. Such a result will open us the possibility 
to manipulate both the single entities and systems by exploiting the same composition rules. We are not far away
from such a result but some important steps remain to be completed.
<br><br>
In the scenario depicted above, there exists different ways a programmer can follow for approaching Jolie. 
He could use its basic and simple features just for solving immediate problems such as integrating different domanin 
applications via light services, or he could exploit the composition mechanisms for building high valued modular distributed systems. 
Moreover, researchers can contribute with their own works by enhancing and analyzing our formal models in order to 
contribute to the final target which is creating a solid and coherent model and tool for designing distributed systems.
Something that will be easy to learn, funny to use and powerful to create.
