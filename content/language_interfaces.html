Jolie allows for the development of distributed applications, thus communication
among services is a key aspect to be considered when building a system with Jolie.
An interface is the Jolie artifact which permits to declare all the functionalities,
called <i>operations</i> exhibited by a service. Every message exchange is fulfilled
by means of an operation.

<h2>Operations</h2>
&gt; <a href="#language_top">Go on top</a><br><br>
An operation is a functionality exposed by a service which can be invoked by other applications. 
Whenever you want to invoke another service, you must do so by invoking one of its operations, 
and vice versa (whenever another application wants to invoke yours, it must do so by invoking an operation of your program).
There are two kinds of operations:
<br><br>
<ul>
<li><i>One-Way</i>: it simply receives a message;</li>
<li><i>Request-Response</i>: it receives a message and then sends back a response.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Interfaces - basic declaration</h2>
&gt; <a href="#language_top">Go on top</a><br><br>
The interface allows for the declaration of a set of operations. They can 
be OneWay operations, RequestResponse operations or both. The basic declaration
of an interface just lists all the name of the operations divided by type:

<h2>Interfaces - message types declaration</h2>
&gt; <a href="#language_top">Go on top</a><br><br>
Interface declaration can be enriched with message types declaration.
OneWay messages require only one message type whereas RequestResponse operations
require both the request and the response type. Left type declaration si the 
request type whereas the right one refers to the response one.
