<h1>Redirection</h1>
Redirection allows for the creation of a master service acting as a single
communication endpoint to multiple services, called resources. The master
service receives all the messages meant for the system that it handles. This
is obtained by binding an input port of the master service to multiple output
ports, each one identifying a service by means of a resource name. Invokers
send messages to the master service specifying also the intended resource
name. The main advantages of such an approach are:<br>
<br>
<ul>
<li>the possibility to provide a unique access point to the system clients. In
this way the services of the system could be relocated and/or replaced
transparently w.r.t. the clients;</li>
<li>the possibility to provide transparent communication protocol transformations 
between the invoker and the master and the master and the
rest of the system.</li>
</ul>

  <div id="caption"><b>Figure Redirection.1:</b> Service <i>M</i> redirects messages to services <i>A</i>, 
<i>B</i> and <i>C</i> depending
on the target destination of the message (<i>M/A</i>, <i>M/B</i> or <i>M/C</i>).
</div>
</div>
In order to understand the second advantage better, consider <b>Fig. Redirection.1</b> and
suppose that <i>A</i> speaks a certain protocol <i>pa</i> . Now suppose that a client needs
to interact with <i>A</i>, but it does know only a diﬀerent protocol: <i>pm</i> . The client
could then call <i>M</i> with destination <i>M/A</i> using protocol <i>pm</i> (known by <i>M</i> ),
and leave to <i>M</i> the task of transforming the call message into an instance of
pa before sending it to <i>A</i>.<br>

<h2>Syntax</h2>
The syntax for setting up a master service follows:
<div id="syntax" src="syntax_redirection"/>
where <i>outputPortId</i> ranges over output port identiﬁers and the form <i>id</i> =>
<i>outputPortId</i> associates a resource name to an output port.
Calling a master service for one of its resources is done by introducing the
resource name in the location used by the invoker, followed by the resource
name separator !/:
