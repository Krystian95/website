<h1>for</h1>

The for statement executes a code block as long as its condition is true. 
A for statement allows the programmer to write an initialization code block 
(which is executed before the first cycle) and a post-cycle code block 
(which is executed after each cycle). The syntax is:

<div id="syntax" src="syntax_for_1"/>

As an example onsider the following code:

<div id="example" src="example_for_1"/>
