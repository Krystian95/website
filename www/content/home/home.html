	new ones in Java.

	Whatever you build, is again a service that you can expose; so,
	it can be reused to build again!

	      <div class="home_section_title">Structured workflows</div>
	      <div class="home_section_text">
	      Jolie comes with native primitives for structuring workflows, for
      example in sequences (one after the other) or parallels (go at the
      same time).
      This makes the code follow naturally from the requirements, avoiding
      error-prone bookkeeping variables for checking what happened so far in a
      computation.
      For example, the following code says that the operations
      <code>publish</code> and <code>edit</code> become available at the
      same time (<code>|</code>), but only after (<code>;</code>) operation
      <code>login</code> is invoked:

	      <div class="home_section_title">Dynamic error handling for parallel code</div>
	      <div class="home_section_text">
	      Programming reliable parallel code is challenging because faults may cause
	      side-effects in parallel activities.
	      Jolie comes with a solid semantics for parallel fault handling.
	      Programmers can update the behaviour of fault handlers at runtime, following the execution of activities 
thanks to the <code>install</code> primitive.
