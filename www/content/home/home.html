	Jolie code is always contained in services, which can be either local
	or remote. You can always move your services from being local to remote and vice versa,
	without altering the logic of your programs.
	Monolithical applications can scale to being distributed by design:
	if you decide to distribute a part of it, just take it and execute it in another machine.<br/>

	Jolie is protocol agnostic: your services can exchange data by using different protocols.
	Bridging two networks using different protocols is a matter of a few lines of code!
	And if you need a protocol that Jolie does not support yet, there is an API for easily developing
	new ones in Java.
