	Jolie code is always contained in services, which you can always move from being local to remote and vice 
versa, without altering the logic of your programs.
	A monolithical application can scale to being distributed by design:
	if you decide to distribute a part of it, just take it and execute it in another machine.<br/>

	Jolie is protocol agnostic: your services can exchange data by using different protocols.
	Bridging two networks using different protocols is a matter of a few lines of code!
	And if you need a protocol that Jolie does not support yet, there is an API for easily developing
	new ones in Java.

	<div class="home_section_text">
	Jolie comes with native primitives for structuring workflows, for
example in sequences (one after the other) or parallels (go at the
same time).
This makes the code follow naturally from the requirements, avoiding
error-prone bookkeeping variables for checking what happened so far in a
computation.
For example, the following code says that the operations
<code>publish</code> and <code>edit</code> become available at the
same time (<code>|</code>), but only after (<code>;</code>) operation
<code>login</code> is invoked:

	Jolie offers many ways for building complex software from simple services.
	Even the deployment architecture of a system can be programmed with native
	primitives, generalising common practices.
	Whatever you build, is again a service that you can expose; so,
	it can be reused to build again!
	Here are some examples of composition:
