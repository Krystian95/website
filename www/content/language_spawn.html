The spawn primitive allows for the dynamic instantiation of parallel activities.
Differently from the <a id="navlink_language_workflow_operators">parallel</a> operator
which allows for the parallel composion of statically defined activities, the
spawn primitive permits to design a set of parallel activities whose number
is defined at runtime. 

<hr>
<a name="language_spawn_syntax"/>
<h2>Syntax</h2>
The syntax of the spawn follows:
<div id="syntax" src="syntax_spawn"/>
where <code>var</code> is the index variable which ranges over <code>range</code>.
<code>resultVar</code> is the variable vector which will containt all the results
from each spawned activity. <code>spSession</code> represents the session code to be 
executed in parallel for each spawn instantiation.
<br><br>
<b>Restrictions</b>
<ul>
  <li>the spawned sessions cannot contain input operations</li>
</ul>


<hr>
<a name="language_spawn_semantics"/>
<h2>Semantics</h2>
The execution of a spawn statement is completed when all its spawned sessions
are completed.
All the spawned sessions must be considered as common <a href="navlink_language_service_sessions">service sessions</a> 
instantiated by the spawn primitive and executed in parallel under the following conditions:
<br><br>
<ul>
  <li>they cannot contain input operations, thus they cannot receive messages from an external service (with the
exception of the response messages of solicit responses). If you need to spawn sessions which are able to 
receive messages from other services, please consult the service oriented pattern <a id="navlink_language_advanced_spawn">Advanced Spawn</a></li>
  <li>they can be instantiated only by means of the spawn primitive</li>
  <li>they cannot exploit correlation sets</li>
  <li>they inherit all the variable values and the outputPort declarations of the current service session which is
executing the spawn</li>
  <li>as usual sessions, all the variables they manage are local to the scope of the spawned session</li>
  <li>they can exploit global variables. Note that global variables are in common to all the sessions of the service</li>
</ul>
