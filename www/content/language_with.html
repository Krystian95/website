<div class="grid_15 prefix_1" id="language-content">
<a name="language_top"/>
<h1>with</h1>

The with statement provides a shortcut for repetitive variable paths.
The syntax follows:
<div id="syntax" src="syntax_with_1"/>

As an example let us consider the following code where we create a data structure
whose root is <i>animals</i>:
<div id="download">&gt; <a href="./content/code/code_with_1.zip">Download code</a></div>
<div id="example" src="example_with_1"/>

It is worth noting that the with statement can be nested as shown in the following example:
<div id="download">&gt; <a href="./content/code/code_with_2.zip">Download code</a></div>
<div id="example" src="example_with_2"/>
<i>wild[0]</i> and <i>wild[1]</i> are both subfields of <i>animals</i> and they are
initialized by using the with statement too.
</div>
