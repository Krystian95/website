JOLIE is all about communicating with services. You can invoke a service or be the service that gets invoked.
Programs get more complex by composing message sendings and/or receivings; as such, the first fundamental notion 
for programming with JOLIE is to understand how to define services and how to communicate.

Ports are necessary both for receiving and sending messages. In Jolie every communication
is fulfilled by means of ports. Three are two kind of ports:
<br><br>
<ul>
<li>Input ports: they are used for receiving messages from other services</li>
<li>Output ports: they are used for sending messages to other services
</ul>

<h2>Operations</h2>
&gt; <a href="#language_top">Go on top</a><br><br>
An operation is a functionality exposed by a service, which can be invoked by other applications. 
Whenever you want to invoke another service, you must do so by invoking one of its operations, 
and vice versa (whenever another application wants to invoke yours, it must do so by invoking an operation of your program).
There are two kinds of operations:
<br><br>
<ul>
<li>One-Way: it simply receives a message;</li>
<li>Request-Response: it receives a message and then sends back a response.</li>
</ul>
<br>
Invocations for One-Way operations are received by using the <i>one-way</i> operation statement, 
while one can invoke a OneWay operation with the <i>notification</i> statement.
Similarly, Request-Response operation invocations are received by using the <i>request-response</i> statement, 
while one can such operations with the <i>solicit-response</i> statement.
