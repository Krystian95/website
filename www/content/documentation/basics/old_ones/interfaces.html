<h1>Interfaces</h1>

<p>Jolie allows the development of distributed applications and communication among services is a key aspect to be considered when building a system with Jolie.</p>
<p>An interface is the artifact used in Jolie for declaring all the functionalities, namely <code>operations</code>, exhibited by a service.</p>
  <p>Every message exchange is fulfilled by means of an operation.</p>
  
<h2>Operations</h2>
<p>An operation is a functionality exposed by a service which can be invoked by other applications. Each time a service invokes another service, it's done by means of its operations.</p>
<p>Jolie provides two kinds of operations:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>One-Way</code>: it receives a message for an operation and stores its content;</li>
<li><code>Request-Response</code>: it receives a message for an operation, executes its behavior and then sends back the result.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Interfaces - basic declaration</h2>

<p>Interfaces are used for declaring sets of both One-Way and Request-Response operations.</p>
<p>The basic declaration of an interface lists all the names of the operations divided by type:</p>
<div class="syntax" src="syntax_interface.ol"/>

<h3>Example - basic declaration</h3>
In the following we present an example of interface declaration:
<div class="code" src="example_interface_1.ol"/>

<h2>Interfaces - message types declaration</h2>
<p>Interface declaration can be enriched with message <a href="#language_types">type</a> declaration.</p>
<p>One-Way messages require only one message type, whereas Request-Response operations require both request and response type.</p>
<div class="syntax" src="syntax_interface_types.ol"/>

<p>Some examples about interface declarations and message types can be found in section <a href="#language_types">Types</a>.

<h2>Interfaces - RequestResponse fault declaration</h2>
<p>Request-Response operations can raise faults as a reply message. Faults must be declared within the interface. Faults can be both typed on un-typed.</p>

<div class="syntax" src="syntax_interface_faults.ol"/>
<p>Some examples about interface declarations with faults can be found at section <a href="#language_fault_handling">Fault handling</a>.
