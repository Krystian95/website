<p>An embedded service in Jolie can communicate with its embedder exploiting the <code>local</code> medium. <code>local</code> communications uses the shared memory between embedded and embedder services in order to handle message delivery in an lightweight and efficient way.</p>
<p>The <code>local</code> medium has no parameters and needs no protocol when used into a protocol definition.</p>
<p>An example using this medium can be found in part &quot;Handling structured messages and embedder's operations invocation&quot; of <a href="architectural_composition/embedding_java">Embedding Java Services</a> subsection.</p>
