Jolie provides a unique linguistic domain for addressing different issues of distributed programming in a service oriented style.
Thanks to Jolie you can build distributed systems starting from the development of simple services and orchestrators
to the composition of complex architectures.
<ul>
  <li><b>Simple services:</b> you can build simple services starting from scratch. 
You can connect them to databases such as SQLServer, PostgreSQL, MySQL and so on
and provide service operations for extracting data from them.
Deploying a Jolie service it is very simple, just type <i>jolie</i> followed
by the service file.
  </li>
  <li><b>Orchestrator:</b> you can build new services by orchestrating the existing ones by developing more complex services called <i>orchestrators</i>.
Differently from standard SOA technologies, in Jolie there are no differences between services and orchestrators 
thus programmers can easily approach them in the same way.
  </li>
  <li><b>Web Applications:</b> in Jolie web applications are considered as service applications where the web GUI
interacts by means of AJAX calls directly with the service operations</li>
  <li><b>System composition:</b> you can integrate and compose exixting SOAs by using the powerful composition mechanisms
of Jolie such as Aggregation, Redirection and Courier sessions</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>In this section we provide both basic and advanced information about Jolie programming.
We invite you to take a look to all the sections and try the proposed examples.
The documentation creation is a continuous work of improvement so, please, send us any comment which can help us to improve it.
