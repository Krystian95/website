			<div><p>Focus (FOundations of  Component-based Ubiquitous Systems) is a joint   effort between Inria (France) and  the University of Bologna (Italy),  and with the external participation of Foundation Bruno Kessler (Trento,  Italy) and ENS Lyon (France).</p>
			<p>Focus investigates the semantic  foundations for Ubiquitous Computing (UC).  The foundations are intended  as instrumental to formalizing and verifying important computational  properties of the systems, as well as to propose linguistic constructs  for them. Prototypes are developed to test the implementability and  usability of the models and the techniques.</p></div>

<h2>Join Us!</h2>

<p>JOLIE is continuously being researched and extended. The JOLIE codebase is engineered with the intent of being easy to extend and modify, so <a href="http://www.jolie-lang.org/contribute.php">you can contribute</a> by coding or doing other activities (like writing documentation, discussing in the mailing list, translating documentation, signalling bugs..). And if you have questions, just ask us in the mailing list or in the #jolie irc channel on freenode.net, we would be happy to help!</p>
