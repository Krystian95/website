# Jolie is open

The Jolie project is open source. The core technology (interpreter and standard library)
is released under the [GNU Library General Public License](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/lgpl.html)
(v2 or later). Sometimes, support tools and external integration libraries are released instead 
under the [Apache License](http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0.html), to allow for the integration
of Jolie in enterprise proprietary software.

Simply put, Jolie can be safely used to develop, coordinate, and integrate proprietary software.
However, all modifications and improvements to the implementation of the Jolie interpreter and related
libraries must be publicly shared.

This website is written in Jolie and it is itself open source: it is included in the SVN repository of the Jolie 
project. Every developer with access to the Jolie codebase can also update the website (directory
`web`).

# The Jolie Team

Jolie is a collaborative effort by many people spread over the world. You can see some of its history
[here](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jolie_%28programming_language%29).
The design of the Jolie language was initially conceived and is
currently moderated by [Claudio Guidi](http://claudioguidi.blogspot.com/) and
[Fabrizio Montesi](http://www.fabriziomontesi.com/).
Releases and improvements are coordinated by the project maintainer,
[Fabrizio Montesi](http://www.fabriziomontesi.com/), and mainly discussed
in our <a href="?top_menu=community" onClick="top_menu('?top_menu=community');return false;"
ref="community" title="community" src="community/community.html">
mailing list</a> and regular online meetings.
The Jolie website is maintained by [Saverio Giallorenzo](http://www.cs.unibo.it/~sgiallor/).

We often use the term `The Jolie Team` to refer to the people who
contributed to the development of Jolie by writing code (copyright holders).
In the list below, we also give credit to people who
contributed to the project through other means (research, useful discussions,
sponsoring, etc.).
