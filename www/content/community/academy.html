			<div class="name">Focus Research Team</div>
			<div><p>Focus (FOundations of  Component-based Ubiquitous Systems) is a joint   effort between Inria (France) and  the University of Bologna (Italy),  and with the external participation of Foundation Bruno Kessler (Trento,  Italy) and ENS Lyon (France).</p>
			<p>Focus investigates the semantic  foundations for Ubiquitous Computing (UC).  The foundations are intended  as instrumental to formalizing and verifying important computational  properties of the systems, as well as to propose linguistic constructs  for them. Prototypes are developed to test the implementability and  usability of the models and the techniques.</p></div>

		<div class="name">mdd4SOA</div>
		<div><p>MDD4SOA is an model-driven development approach for SOA applications. It is based on UML2 models and model transformations. UML2 is extended to model service-oriented software; in particular, for modelling orchestrations of services inside a SOA-based system. MDD4SOA was developed within the scope of the SENSORIA project.</div>
