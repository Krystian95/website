In order to exploit all the programming power of Java, Jolie provides the possibility to integrate Java code into a 
Jolie service by implementing a JavaService. This approach can be particularly useful, e.g., when you need to create a graphical 
user interface or you want to integrate your own Java code into a Service-Oriented Architecture. 
In order to create a JavaService we have to extend the JavaService class, which is in the package <i>jolie.runtime.JavaService</i>, 
and then embedding it into a Jolie service.

<a name="language_javaservices_first_javaservice"/>
<h2>The first Javaservice</h2>
&gt; <a href="#language_top">Go on top</a><br><br>
Here we describe the procedure for creating a JavaService by exploiting <a href="http://www.netbeans.org" target="netbeans">Netbeans IDE</a>, 
but you can use the Java developing framework you prefer. 

<h3>Creating a new project</h3>
First of all we need to create a new Java Application project within Netbeans:
<div id="figure">
  <img src="./images/javaservices_netbeans1.jpeg">
  <div id="caption"><b>Figure Javaservices.1</b>: Netbeans project creation mask.
</div>
</div>
Then, we name the project <i>FirstJavaService</i> and we add to its Libraries list the jolie project we have previously
downloaded following the istructions listed in this <a href="#language_install">page</a>. The jolie project contains
the Java declaration of the abstract class <i>JavaService</i> (<i>jolie.runtime.JavaService</i>) we will extend for 
creating our JavaService.

<h3>Creating a new package</h3>
Before writing down the code of our first JavaService, we create the package which will contain it.
<div id="figure">
  <img src="./images/javaservices_netbeans2.jpeg">
  <div id="caption"><b>Figure Javaservices.2</b>: Creation of the package <i>jolie.example</i>.
</div>
</div>

<h3>Creating the Java file</h3>
Then, we create the Java file and we name it with same name of the JavaService that is <i>FirstJavaService</i>.
<div id="figure">
  <img src="./images/javaservices_netbeans3.jpeg">
  <div id="caption"><b>Figure Javaservices.3</b>: Creation of the Java file.
</div>
</div>

<h3>Writing the Java code and building it</h3>
In the following, we create our first JavaService which prints out a message on the console. The Java code follows:
<div id="example" src="example_javaservices_1"/><br>
Finally we can build the Java file into a <i>.jar</i> file.

<h3>Executing the JavaService</h3>
In order to be executed the Javaservice always needs to be embedded by a jolie service which will 
invokes it as a common embedded service as we have described in <a href="#language_embedding">Embedding</a>.
All the public methods of the JavaService can be invoked as they are operations of a Jolie service.
In particular, this example has one public method called <i>write</i> which can be easily invoked
by the following embedder:
<div id="example" src="example_javaservices_2"/><br>
<div id="download">&gt; <a href="./content/code/code_javaservices_1.zip">Download code</a></div>
Note that the embedded construct takes as a type the keyword Java instead of Jolie because we are embedding a JavaService. 
As parameter the embedded construct takes the absolute class name obtained as <i>package_name+class_name</i>.
As for a Jolie service, the embedder must declare the interface of the embedded service and the outputPort used for communicating with it. 
In this case the interface contains a OneWay operation called write whereas the outputPort is called <i>MyFirstJavaServicePort</i>.
It is worth noting that the embedder must be run by passing the JavaService jar file as a parameter by using the option <i>-l</i>
as shown below:
<div id="example" src="example_javaservices_3"/><br>

<a name="language_javaservices_value"/>
<h2>Manipulating jolie values in Java</h2>
&gt; <a href="#language_top">Go on top</a><br><br>
So far, we have sent a very simple message to the JavaService that is a string. But, it could be useful to send
an entire Jolie value tree. Before showing the way for accomplishing this issue, we have to introduce the
Java class <i>Value</i>. Such a class allows for the manipulation of Jolie value trees in Java.
<br><br>
<b>Creating a value.</b><br>
First of all, we need to create a Value in Java as we would do in Jolie.
The following Java code creates a Value.
<div id="example" src="example_javaservices_6"/><br>

<b>Getting the vector elements.</b><br>
In each Jolie tree, a node is a vector. In order to access/get the vector elements of a node,
you can use the method <i>getChildren(String subnodeName) </i> which returns the corresponding <i>ValueVector</i>
of the subnode <i>subnondeName</i>. In the following example we get all the vector elements of the subnode
<i>sub_node1</i>.
<div id="example" src="example_javaservices_7"/><br>

In order to access the element at index <i>i</i> it is possible to use the method <i>get(int index)</i>.
In the following example we access the third element of the subnode <i>sub_node1</i>.
<div id="example" src="example_javaservices_8"/><br>
It is worth noting that an element of a ValueVector is a Value and that the first element
of a ValueVector is the element at the index 0.
<br><br>
<b>Getting the value of an element.</b><br>
Once accessed a vector element (a value in general), it is possible to get its value
by simply using one of the following methods depending on the type of the content:
<ul>
  <li>strValue()</li>
  <li>intValue()</li>
  <li>longValue()</li>
  <li>boolValue()</li>
  <li>doubleValue()</li>
</ul>

In the following example we suppose to print out the content of the second element of the subnode 
<i>sub_node1</i> supposing it is a string.
<div id="example" src="example_javaservices_9"/><br>

<b>Setting the value of an element.</b><br>
Analogously, it is possible to use the method <i>setValue( ... )</i> for setting the value content.


<a name="language_javaservices_calling_embedder"/>
<h2>Calling an operation of the embedder from the Javaservice</h2>
&gt; <a href="#language_top">Go on top</a><br><br>
A JavaService can be also programmed for calling an operation of the embedder by using the method <i>sendMessage</i> of the class 
<i>JavaService</i>. Such a feature is particularly useful when we want to create a JavaService which has an active role instead 
of always waiting to be invoked by the mebedder. As an example, we extend the previous JavaService by introducing an invocation of 
a OneWay operation of the embedder called <i>writeBack</i>:
<div id="example" src="example_javaservices_4"/><br>
The class <i>CommMessage</i> (package <i>jolie.net</i>) represents a Jolie communication message which is sent to the embedder by means of the 
JavaService method <i>sendMessage</i>. The method send message indeed requires a message which is created by exploiting the static
methods <i>createRequest</i>. In this case the message has been initialized with the following parameters:
<ul>
<li>"writeBack": the name of the operation of the embedder to call</li>
<li>"/": which specifies the service path (see <a href="#language_redirection">Redirection</a>)</li>
<li>v : which is a Value object that contains the data structure to send.</li>
</ul>
In this case the message to send contains a string: <i>"Hello world from the JavaService!"</i>.
It is worth noting that the class <i>CommMessage</i> provides different static methods for creating
a request message and a response message. In this example we have created a request message because 
the JavaService invokes a OneWay operation of the embedder.
The embedder follows:
<div id="example" src="example_javaservices_5"/><br>
In this case the embedder must declare its own inputPort where it will receive messages from the embedded service. 
The embedder exhibits a OneWay operation called <i>writeBack</i>. In the main procedure the embedder calls the JavaService 
by means of the operation <i>write</i> then waits for a message on the operation <i>writeBack</i>.<br>

<a name="language_javaservices_annotation"/>
<h2>Annotations</h2>
&gt; <a href="#language_top">Go on top</a><br><br>
Each public method programmed within a JavaService must be considered 
as an input operation that can be invoked from the embedder. Depending on the return object the method represents a OneWay operation or a RequestResponse one. If the return type is void, the operation is considered a OneWay operation, a RequestResponse operation otherwise.
You can override this behaviour by using the @RequestResponse annotation, which forces Jolie to consider the annotated method as a RequestResponse operation.
