				<div class="name">Chor</div>
				<div class="highlights"><b>Highlights: </b>
					<ul>
						<li>a new programming language based on choreographies that supports code generation of Jolie services.</li>
					</ul>
				</div><div class="clear"></div>
				<div><p>Chor is a new programming language for communicating systems, based on choreographies. Choreographies are global descriptions of system implementations, where the behaviour of all entities in a system is given in a single program. Choreographies enhance the quality of software, as they represent "formal blueprints" of how communicating systems should behave and offer a concise view of the message flows enacted by a system. In Chor, a choreography can then be projected (or compiled, if you like) onto a set of separate programs that can be run in a distributed system. </p></div>

				<div class="name">Jeye</div>
				<div class="highlights"><b>Highlights: </b>
					<ul>
						<li>A web designer for Jolie services.</li>
					</ul>
				</div><div class="clear"></div>
				<div><p>jEye is web application which allows for the design of Jolie workflow by exploiting a web GUI developed in GWT.
					The server side of jEye is a Service Oriented Architecture fully implemented with Jolie. In particular,
					we exploit service recursion for developing the Jolie parser which converts the wirkflow definition provided
					by the web GUI into a real and executable Jolie service. At the present jEys is a prototype.</p></div>
