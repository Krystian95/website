<h1>Joliepse</h1>
<p class="cite">An IDE for Jolie powered by Xtext framework.</p>

<p>Joliepse is an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) for the Jolie programming language, powered by the <a href="http://www.eclipse.org/Xtext/">Xtext framework</a>. Joliepse provides code templating, code completion, syntax colouring, navigation, reference finding, outline views and syntax checking / error markers.</p>

<p>In the video above you can see all the power of Joliepse in action, with the simple professor - students example from the <em><a href="http://www.Jolie-lang.org/?top_menu=documentation&sideMenuAction=basics/sessions">sessions</a></em> part of the tutorial.</p>

<h2>Installation</h2>
<p>Joliepse can be installed from the following update site, using the standard Eclipse plugin installation process ("help" -> "install new software" add this URL in <em>location</em> and deselect <em>group items by category</em>) from Eclipse Helios:</p>

<p><code>http://Jolie.svn.sourceforge.net/viewvc/Jolie/experimental/Jolie-xtext/playground/Joliepse/JoliepseIDE/</code></p>

<p>You can also check out the source using SVN:</p>

<p><code>svn co http://Jolie.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/Jolie/experimental/Jolie-xtext/playground/Joliepse/</code></p>

<h2>Short introduction</h2>
<p>When you install Joliepse, in the choosen workspace a project named <em>JolieIncludedLibraries</em> is automatically created. This project contains a copy of the include directory of your Jolie installation, and allows you to have the proposal provider and the code navigation functionality for the basic Jolie services like <em>console</em>.</p>
<p>If after the installation of Joliepse the JolieIncludedLibraries project is not automatically installed, please manually create a project with this name and import in it the <em>include</em> directory of your Jolie installation.</p>
<p>To start a new Jolie project, File -> New -> Project... -> General -> Project and choose a name. To create a Jolie file, double click on this project and New -> File, choose the name ending with .ol or .iol extension and add Xtext nature at the project.</p>
<p>At any point of the program, you can call the <em>content assist</em> with <em>CTRL (CMD on Mac) + space</em> shortcut for suggestions, code completion and <em>code template</em>. You can modify or add new code template, take a look at <a href="http://help.eclipse.org/ganymede/index.jsp?topic=/org.eclipse.cdt.doc.user/tasks/cdt_t_imp_code_temp.htm">here</a>.</p>
<p>You can <em>browse</em> the code and open declarations (i.e., define, type, imported file, etc.) by clicking on identificators in the source code while pressing the CTRL key on the keyboard (CMD on Mac).</p>
<p>If you want to run your Jolie interpreter directly from Eclipse, like at the end of the video: run -> External Tools -> External Tools Configurations -> Double click on Program: </p>
<ul>
	<li>Choose a name, e.g., "Jolie program";</li>
	<li>in Location put the Jolie launcher script path (specified in the buildconfig/config.properties file of the source code of Jolie, default: <code>/usr/local/bin/Jolie</code>);</li>
	<li>in the arguments panel put <code>${workspace_loc}${selected_resource_path}</code>, without the quotes;</li>
	<li>finally you can launch a Jolie program with a click in the main panel, like at the and of the video.</li>
</ul>
