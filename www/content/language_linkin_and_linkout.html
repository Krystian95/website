Primitives linkIn and linkOut allows for the inner synchronization among activities in parallel.
In particular, linkIn waits for a signal from a concurrent linkOut primitive. It is worth noting 
that linkIn is blocked until a signal is received from a linkOut whereas linkOut is a not blocking primitive. 
The syntax is:
<div id="syntax" src="syntax_linkin_and_linkout_1"/>
<div id="syntax" src="syntax_linkin_and_linkout_2"/>
where <i>signal_name</i> is the signal on which a linkIn and a linkOut will synchornize.
In Fig. LinkInAndLinkOut.1 we graphically represents a scenario where two parallel
activities are synchronized on signal <i>sig</i>.
