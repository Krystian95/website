  abstract =     "We investigate the issue of designing a kernel
                 programming language for mobile computing and describe
                 KLAIM, a language that supports a programming paradigm
                 where processes, like data, can be moved from one
                 computing environment to another. The language consists
                 of a core Linda with multiple tuple spaces and of a set
                 of operators for building processes. KLAIM naturally
                 supports programming with explicit localities.
                 Localities are first-class data (they can be
                 manipulated like any other data), but the language
                 provides coordination mechanisms to control the
                 interaction protocols among located processes. The
                 formal operational semantics is useful for discussing
                 the design of the language and provides guidelines for
                 implementations. KLAIM is equipped with a type system
                 that statically checks access rights violations of
                 mobile agents. Types are used to describe the
                 intentions (read, write, execute, etc.) of processes in
                 relation to the various localities. The type system is
                 used to determine the operations that processes want to
                 perform at each locality, and to check whether they
                 comply with the declared intentions and whether they
                 have the necessary rights to perform the intended
                 operations at the specific localities. Via a series of
                 examples, we show that many mobile code programming
                 paradigms can be naturally implemented in our kernel
                 language. We also present a prototype implementaton of
                 KLAIM in Java.",

                 styles of software composition. The core features of
                 Piccola are communicating agents, which perform
                 computations, and forms, which are the communicated
                 values. Forms are a special notion of extensible,
                 immutable records. Forms and agents allow us to unify
                 components, static and dynamic contexts and arguments
                 for invoking services. Through a series of examples, we

                 message passing, together with a typing system
                 assigning typings to terms in the calculus. Types meant
                 to describe the kind of messages an object may receive
                 are assigned to the free names in a program resulting
                 in a scenario where a program is assigned multiple
                 name-type pairs, constituting a typing for the process.
                 Programs that comply to the typing discipline are shown
                 not to suffer from runtime errors. Furthermore the
                 calculus possesses a notation of principal typings,
                 from which all typings that make a program well-typed
                 can be extracted. We present an efficient algorithm to
                 extract the principal typing of a process.",
