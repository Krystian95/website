# Jolie is open

The Jolie project is open source. The core technology (interpreter and standard library)
is released under the [GNU Library General Public License](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/lgpl.html)
(v2 or later). Sometimes, support tools and external integration libraries are released instead 
under the [Apache License](http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0.html), to allow for the integration
of Jolie in enterprise proprietary software.

Simply put, Jolie can be safely used to develop, coordinate, and integrate proprietary software.
However, all modifications and improvements to the implementation of the Jolie interpreter and related
libraries must be publicly shared.
If you are in doubt about your usage of Jolie, please [contact us](community.html).

This website is written in Jolie and it is itself open source: it is included in the SVN repository of the Jolie 
project. Every developer with access to the Jolie codebase can also update the website (directory
`web`).
